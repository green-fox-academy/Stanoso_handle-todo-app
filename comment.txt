printArguments - I would put this method inside the ToDo Class, because it is a part of it.

line 17 - else, you are checking just the value 1, what about the value 0? I know it should never happened, but you never know who may do sth with your code. So I would recommend to put else if(length > 1)

the property toDoNote is probably useless, it doesnt really tell us anything about the state of the object and in the methods you can just pass the string directly.

line 52 - no need to store it in another variable, the name of the method "isInteger" is really well chosen, self-explanatory, but I ca understand it, I was doing exactly the same :)

completeTask and RemoveTodo are kinda similar in few ways try to think about how you can avoid the code duplication.

remember the SRP principle? - if you have time for that I would suggest to divided your code into more services, Eg a service/class for handling the I/O etc....there are more ways....

Looks like I have just negative things, but NOPE, I think it is really well done :) Seriously, good job!
